## Advantages of Angular overy Jquery in this example
- code enabling/disabling submit button is way simpler - `ng-disabled` vs `$('#submit).prop('disabled', ...)`
- with Jquery, need to remember to write code to enable *and* disable button
- with Jquery, need to write method that is called when text changes.  Angular does this automatically
